(WIP) Cheap Chinese Video Recorder companion software.

This project aims to replace the CMS and VMS software provided with cheap chinese DVRs and NVRs. The original software is closed-source, requires admin privileges, runs only on Windows and is difficult to use. Our mission is to fix that.

There are already open-source multi-platform tools related to the DVRs and NVRs that have dissected most of the protocol used (Sofia), but those provide no easy-to-use GUI and are not meant as a replacement of the manufacturer's software.
